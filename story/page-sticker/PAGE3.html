         But as he sat there alone in the cold morning gloom,
         Roberto suddenly found himself humming a tune.
         
         And the next then he knew, he had lept to his feet and then started dancing,
         right there in the street.
         
         Roberto decided, right there and right then that he would find new
         friends to dance with again.
         -->
         As he sat alone in the cold morning gloom, Roberto heard a squawk and yowl
         sound out in the alley. A truck horn add a low blast, and a
         church bell chimed in with the melody. Roberto swung his legs and drummed
         out a beat.

         It wasn't his dad's band, but it was a tune. Roberto jumped to his feet,
         and before he knew it, he was dancing in the street.
         &ldquo;Now, to find a friend,&rdquo; Roberto decided.
