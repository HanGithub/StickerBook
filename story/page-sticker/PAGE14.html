         By late afternoon Roberto had found many animals, but none of the birds,
         rabbits, dogs, or squirrels wanted dance with him.
         
         Roberto was tired. It had been a long day and he decided 
         to take a nap under the shade of an old tree.
         
         Just as he was dozing off, a girl from the city happened to walk by.
         She found Roberto sleeping and cautiously tapped him to wake him up.
