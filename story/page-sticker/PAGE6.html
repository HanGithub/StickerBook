         And then without waiting for the bird to reply, Roberto began to dance.

         So he marched to the corner and turned to his right
         and encountered a bird perched up on a light.

         He forgot all his worries as he danced and he hopped.
         Roberto forgot all his concerns <i>and</i> he forgot to stop!
