      <span style="font-size: 42pt;">T</span>his is Roberto, and it's sad to say
      that he just moved from his home far, far away.
      
      He missed his old house, his old bed, his old street.
      
      And he missed going dancing with the friends that he'd meet.
      -->
      
      <span style="font-size: 42pt;">R</span>oberto had nothing to do. When the
      sun rose, he just wanted to go back to bed. At his old home, he'd be dancing
      through the hills by now.
      </p>
      <p>
         But two days ago, Roberto and his family had moved to the city. Roberto
         missed his old house, his old neighborhood, his old
         school. But most of all he missed dancing with his friends.
