      that he just moved from his home far, far away.
      
      He missed his old house, his old bed, his old street.
      
      And he missed going dancing with the friends that he'd meet.

      <span style="font-size: 42pt;">R</span>oberto had nothing to do. When the
      sun rose, he just wanted to go back to bed. At his old home, he'd be dancing
      through the hills by now.
   </p>
   <p>
      But two days ago, Roberto and his family had moved to the city. Roberto
      missed his old house, his old neighborhood, his old
      school. But most of all he missed dancing with his friends.

      But as he sat there alone in the cold morning gloom,
      Roberto suddenly found himself humming a tune.
      
      And the next then he knew, he had lept to his feet and then started dancing,
      right there in the street.
      
      Roberto decided, right there and right then that he would find new
      friends to dance with again.
      -->
      As he sat alone in the cold morning gloom, Roberto heard a squawk and yowl
      sound out in the alley. A truck horn add a low blast, and a
      church bell chimed in with the melody. Roberto swung his legs and drummed
      out a beat.
   </p>
   <p>
      It wasn't his dad's band, but it was a tune. Roberto jumped to his feet,
      and before he knew it, he was dancing in the street.
      &ldquo;Now, to find a friend,&rdquo; Roberto decided.

      So he marched to the end of the street and saw a bird perched on a
      lamppost.
   </p><p>
      &ldquo;Hello there,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;do you like to dance?
      I'll be your new friend if you give me a chance.&rdquo;
   </p>
   <p>
      And then without waiting for the bird to reply, Roberto began to dance.
      As he danced, he forgot all of his worries, but he also forgot to <i>stop</i>
      dancing!

   <p>
      So he marched to the corner and turned to his right
      and encountered a bird perched up on a light.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      And then without waiting for a word of reply,
      Roberto started to dance as the old bird stood by.
      
      He forgot all his worries as he danced and he hopped.
      Roberto forgot all his concerns <i>and</i> he forgot to stop!

      &ldquo;You dance too much!&rdquo; the bird squawked.

   </p>
   <img src="illustrations/page5.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
   <p>
      And watching the bird as it flew away, Roberto thought to himself,
      <i>I won't give up.</i>

      So he walked to the corner and turned to his right, and there were three
      cats, orange, black, and white. -->
      He turned the corner to search for another friend. Three cats looked up from
      their morning meal.
   </p>
   <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it be fun for us all to dance together?&rdquo;

      And then, three times, Roberto gave a tip of his hat and performed his whole dance,
      once for each cat.

      By late afternoon Roberto had found many animals, but none of the birds,
      rabbits, dogs, or squirrels wanted dance with him.
      
      Roberto was tired. It had been a long day and he decided 
      to take a nap under the shade of an old tree.
      
      Just as he was dozing off, a girl from the city happened to walk by.
      She found Roberto sleeping and cautiously tapped him to wake him up.
