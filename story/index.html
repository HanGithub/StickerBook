      just moved from his home ten miles away.
   </p>
   
   <p>

      At his old home and on his old street 
      he had many friends that he liked to go meet.
      They'd meet and they'd dance there on his old street,
      and he'd dance and he'd dance with his two dancing feet.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      But as sat there alone in the cold morning gloom
      he suddenly started humming a tune.
      
      And he started to <i>dance</i> right there and right then,
      and he thought I'll go find new friends to dance with again.

      So he marched to the corner and turned to his right
      and encountered a bird perched up on a light.
      &ldquo;Hello there&rdquo;, he smiled &ldquo;do you like to dance?
      I'll be your new friend if you give me a chance.&rdquo;
   </p>
   
   <p>
      And then without waiting for a word of reply,
      Roberto started to dance as the old bird stood by.
      
      Roberto forgot all his worries as he danced and he hopped.
      He forgot his concerns <i>and</i> he forgot to stop!

      Can you make Roberto dance without stopping?<br>

      You do <i>too</i> much dancing&rdquo;, the bird suddenly squawked.
      &ldquo;How could I dance with someone who won't ever stop?&rdquo;
   </p>
   <img src="illustrations/page5.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
   <p>
      And watching the bird as it flew away, Roberto thought to himself,
      <i>I won't be dismayed.</i>

      So he walked to the corner and turned to his right, and there were three
      cats, orange, black, and white. Three times Roberto gave a tip of his hat
      and performed his whole dance, once for each cat.

      The cats all yawned and stuck their tails in the air.
      &ldquo;Dance all you want, why should we care?&rdquo;
